#### ðŸ’ŽPassionately Crafted With ðŸ’–

## Notes
1. Some parts of the code could be simplified ( didn't have time ðŸ˜¥ )
2. Application is **not** totally responsive. 
3. To check linting ( **format on save** + **Intellisense** ), please install the following extensions:
	- `ESLint`
	- `stylelint`
4. The design is not too good.
